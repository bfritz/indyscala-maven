# Using Maven with Scala Projects

---

# Why Not SBT?

If you...

* are introducing Scala into **existing Maven project**,
* are learning Scala and **already know Maven**,
* need **something Maven provides** that SBT does not yet, or
* just **hate Ivy**.

---

# Challanges

* Momentum favors SBT
* Incremental compilation support trails SBT
* Recent versions require Maven 3.x
